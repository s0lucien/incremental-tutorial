(* Let's start with something very simple. Take a look at the
   functions in [Simple]. Your goal is to write incremental verisons
   of these same functions.

   You can run this implementation as follows.
   {v
    ./_build/default/exercises/main.exe ex1 simple
   v}

   Note that we don't expect a practical performance improvement here.
   the goal is just to get a sense of how to use the Incremental
   primitives.

   {v
    ./_build/default/exercises/main.exe ex1 incremental
   v}

     closely, except:

     - OCaml references should be replaced with [Incr.Var.t]'s
     - [metric] should be called just once
     - An observer should be created based on the result of [metric]
     - [Incr.stabilize] needs to be called as part of [compute]
     - [compute] should then get its value using [Incr.Observer.value_exn].
